=== TODO (in order of priority)
* Add support for <tt>~/.gemrc</tt>
* Add support for configuring multiple gem servers.
* Remove any unnecessary “complex” code.
* Bring back to _one_ file, or at least less files if it doesn't harm
  readability.

==== Laurents wish list
* More commands:
  * +uninstall+
  * +search+
  * +update+
  * +list+
